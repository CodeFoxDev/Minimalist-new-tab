# Install guide
1. Go into the src folder, and download the files as a zip folder.
2. Unzip it to a directory of your choosing, but remember that if you delete the directory that the extension will stop working!
3. Go to chrome://extensions, and enable developermode if you haven't already. (Click the switch in the top-right corner)
4. After that you should see a button labelled: load unpacked.
5. Click on that and navigate to the folder containing the extension data, and open that folder.
6. Now in the extension list there should be an extension called: Minimalist new tab.
7. Once you open a new tab, there will be a pop-up asking if you want to keep this extension as your new tab, and click on confirm (or something else).
8. Now the extension is installed, enjoy your minimalist new tab!
# Customization guide
Currently the only thing you can customize is the default google user for the apps.
To change it:
1. Open the inspector (ctrl+shift+i / ctrl+shift+c) console and enter the following ``` setDefaultUser(user)```, and user being the number of the preffered account (0, 1, 2, etc.).
2. And press enter, the page will now refresh and all links should have changed to match your preference.

More customization options will come in the future, and if you have improvements or feedback, please let me know!
